# A Classification-model-in-Rstudio
Designed a classification model to classify authenticity of cuisines on YELP restaurant dataset using R studio. The dataset was in JSON format and it was imported into R and data cleaning , data preprocessing , data manipulation steps were done to prepare the model for statistical data analysis. Principal componenet analysis was done to reduce the redundant variables and redcue the variance. using correlation plots, variables were chosen for training,validation and testing dataset. Random forest algorithm was used as to classify the dependent variable based on several predictors like type of cuisine, rating of cuisine, city etc.
